# Personal Blog 

## Motivations:
I need a digital garden to show my past-present and future self so I created a blog/personal website. Why I call it a digital garden? I believe our mind is a garden which is why we need to proactively take care of our mind. Here is one of my favorite quote: “plant your own gardens and decorate your own soul, instead of waiting for someone to bring you flowers.” The header portion is the perfect representation of honoring my asian inheritance and my appreciation for food and art.  Our past doesn’t define our future which is the meaning of my logo on the right upper corner.
